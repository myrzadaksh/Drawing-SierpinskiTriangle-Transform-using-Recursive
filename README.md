# Drawing-SierpinskiTriangle-Transform-using-Recursive

Overview:

This repository contains three unique projects that focus on fractals and 2D transformations. Each project uses Java and StdDraw for visualizing the output.

- Sierpinski: Generates the famous Sierpinski Triangle fractal recursively.

- Transform2D: Demonstrates basic 2D transformations (scaling, translating, and rotating) on a polygon.

- Art: Creates recursive art with branching lines that form a fractal tree structure.

These projects offer a hands-on understanding of fractal patterns and 2D transformations using recursive algorithms.


Projects Overview:

1)Sierpinski

This project generates a Sierpinski Triangle fractal using recursion. The Sierpinski Triangle is one of the most famous fractals, created by repeatedly subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller ones.

How it works:

- The sierpinski method is a recursive function that draws a filled triangle and then calls itself to draw three smaller triangles in each iteration.

- The depth of recursion determines the detail of the fractal (higher values create more detailed patterns).
  

2)Transform2D

This project demonstrates basic 2D geometric transformations—scaling, translation, and rotation—on a polygon.

How it works:

- The scale method scales the coordinates of a polygon by a factor alpha.

- The translate method moves the polygon by adding values dx and dy to the x and y coordinates, respectively.

- The rotate method rotates the polygon by a given angle theta, in degrees.
  

3)Art
 
This project generates recursive art in the form of branching lines. It is a simple implementation of recursive fractals, producing patterns such as trees or branching shapes.

How it works:

- The recursiveFunction method draws a line segment, and then recursively draws two more line segments at an angle, creating a branching effect.

- The angle and size of each branch decrease with each recursion depth.
