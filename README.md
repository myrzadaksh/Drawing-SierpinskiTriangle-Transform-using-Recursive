# Drawing-SierpinskiTriangle-Transform-using-Recursive

Overview:

This repository contains three unique projects that focus on fractals and 2D transformations. Each project uses Java and StdDraw for visualizing the output.

- Sierpinski: Generates the famous Sierpinski Triangle fractal recursively.

- Transform2D: Demonstrates basic 2D transformations (scaling, translating, and rotating) on a polygon.

- Art: Creates recursive art with branching lines that form a fractal tree structure.

These projects offer a hands-on understanding of fractal patterns and 2D transformations using recursive algorithms.
